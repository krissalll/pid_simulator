# PID Simulator

A PID Simulator app built on the Flutter framework

## Getting Started

This is a small university project that simulates a rotating actuator with inertia and friction that can be controlled by PID parameters and a desired angle. The app has a user interface and user can drag the lever to a desired offset angle and watch the system react in real time based on the given PID input.

The PID and Angle knobs can be turned by clicking and dragging up or down.

To view source code, go inside the 'lib' directory.
